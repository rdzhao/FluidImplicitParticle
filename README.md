# FluidImplicitParticle

This is a prototype of Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) for fluid simulation which is widely applied in movie and game industry.

Results will be written into two folders "particles" and "velocitygrids". Just remember to create these two folders before running the code.

For more details, please refer to the book "Fluid Simulation for Computer Graphics" by Robert Bridson.

Have fun playing with the code.
